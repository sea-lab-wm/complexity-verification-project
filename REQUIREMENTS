OS:
Ubuntu 20.04 (for OpenJML experiments only); everything else should work on any unix system
       - pre-collected data is available for OpenJML (and other tools), so the artifact can still be mostly evaluated even if you cannot run OpenJML

Software:
Python 3
Java JDKs (all of versions 8, 11, and 17)
R Studio (tested on version 2022.12.0.+353)
R (tested on version 4.2.2)
