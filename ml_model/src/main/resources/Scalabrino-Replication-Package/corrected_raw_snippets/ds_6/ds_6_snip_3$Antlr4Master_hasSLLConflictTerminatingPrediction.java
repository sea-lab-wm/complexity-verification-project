/**
 * Computes the SLL prediction termination condition.
 *
 * <p>
 * This method computes the SLL prediction termination condition for both of
 * the following cases.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The usual SLL+LL fallback upon SLL conflict</li>
 * <li>Pure SLL without LL fallback</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>COMBINED SLL+LL PARSING</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>When LL-fallback is enabled upon SLL conflict, correct predictions are
 * ensured regardless of how the termination condition is computed by this
 * method. Due to the substantially higher cost of LL prediction, the
 * prediction should only fall back to LL when the additional lookahead
 * cannot lead to a unique SLL prediction.</p>
 *
 * <p>Assuming combined SLL+LL parsing, an SLL configuration set with only
 * conflicting subsets should fall back to full LL, even if the
 * configuration sets don't resolve to the same alternative (e.g.
 * {@code {1,2}} and {@code {3,4}}. If there is at least one non-conflicting
 * configuration, SLL could continue with the hopes that more lookahead will
 * resolve via one of those non-conflicting configurations.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here's the prediction termination rule them: SLL (for SLL+LL parsing)
 * stops when it sees only conflicting configuration subsets. In contrast,
 * full LL keeps going when there is uncertainty.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>HEURISTIC</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>As a heuristic, we stop prediction when we see any conflicting subset
 * unless we see a state that only has one alternative associated with it.
 * The single-alt-state thing lets prediction continue upon rules like
 * (otherwise, it would admit defeat too soon):</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;}</p>
 *
 * <p>When the ATN simulation reaches the state before {@code ';'}, it has a
 * DFA state that looks like: {@code [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]}. Naturally
 * {@code 12|1|[]} and {@code 12|2|[]} conflict, but we cannot stop
 * processing this node because alternative to has another way to continue,
 * via {@code [6|2|[]]}.</p>
 *
 * <p>It also let's us continue for this rule:</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code [1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]] a : A | A | A B ;}</p>
 *
 * <p>After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
 * State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
 * conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
 * However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not stop
 * working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned with
 * states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt 3 is not
 * associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
 * looking for input reasonably, don't declare the state done.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>PURE SLL PARSING</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>To handle pure SLL parsing, all we have to do is make sure that we
 * combine stack contexts for configurations that differ only by semantic
 * predicate. From there, we can do the usual SLL termination heuristic.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>PREDICATES IN SLL+LL PARSING</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>SLL decisions don't evaluate predicates until after they reach DFA stop
 * states because they need to create the DFA cache that works in all
 * semantic situations. In contrast, full LL evaluates predicates collected
 * during start state computation so it can ignore predicates thereafter.
 * This means that SLL termination detection can totally ignore semantic
 * predicates.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementation-wise, {@link ATNConfigSet} combines stack contexts but not
 * semantic predicate contexts so we might see two configurations like the
 * following.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code (s, 1, x, {}), (s, 1, x', {p})}</p>
 *
 * <p>Before testing these configurations against others, we have to merge
 * {@code x} and {@code x'} (without modifying the existing configurations).
 * For example, we test {@code (x+x')==x''} when looking for conflicts in
 * the following configurations.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code (s, 1, x, {}), (s, 1, x', {p}), (s, 2, x'', {})}</p>
 *
 * <p>If the configuration set has predicates (as indicated by
 * {@link ATNConfigSet#hasSemanticContext}), this algorithm makes a copy of
 * the configurations to strip out all of the predicates so that a standard
 * {@link ATNConfigSet} will merge everything ignoring predicates.</p>
